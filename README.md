 <h2 align="center">Company Overview</h2>

**Cupcakes & Coffee** is a Netherlands based café chain that operates across 7 city regions, offering artisanal cupcakes and specialty coffee.

Since launching, the brand has grown steadily and developed a loyal customer base, but management sees untapped potential in emerging markets. To achieve sustainable expansion, Cupcakes & Coffee seeks to identify new locations for strategic growth through a data-driven analysis of sales, customer reach, product demand, and regional performance.

Reporting to the **Head of Strategy and Business Development**, a market performance review was conducted to identify the top 3 cities with the strongest combination of demand, profitability, and long-term growth viability.

The analysis focused on the following **metrics:**

 •	**Sales Performance:** Measuring total revenue and order volumes across cities.

 •	**Customer Reach:** Evaluating potential market size and coffee-drinking population per city.

 •	**Profitability Ratio:** Comparing average revenue per customer to average rent per region.

 •	**Market Traction:** Assessing sustained sales growth and consistency over time.

1. **Revenue Growth and Peak Performance:**
   - October 2023 marked the strongest performance period, with a 195% month-over-month sales growth, indicating a sales surge possibly driven by seasonal or promotional events.
   - Following this peak, sales remained strong through November 2023 to February 2024, sustaining healthy revenue levels above $15K.
   - March 2024 saw a secondary recovery, growing 16% month-over-month, reinforcing consistent buyer activity in Q1 2024.

2. **Declining Trend in 2022**
   - Noticeable downturns occurred in April (–73%) and May (–32%), signaling potential seasonal demand dips or a slowdown in returning customers.
   - Despite these declines, sales stabilized from June through September, showing small but steady gains between +1% to +23%.
   - These fluctuations indicate a pattern of cyclical sales volatility, with rapid surges followed by short recovery periods.

3. **Quarterly Insights & Seasonal Trends**
   - Q3 and Q4 2023 demonstrated the strongest revenue periods, with October’s performance far surpassing the annual average.
   - Early 2024 showed moderate performance overall, led by March and July growth spikes, suggesting that strategic marketing during recovery months can maintain consistent performance.
   - The data suggests post-peak stabilization rather than continued exponential growth — ideal for planning retention-focused campaigns.

4. **Key Takeaways & Recommendations**
   - Investigate drivers of October’s 195% surge (e.g., seasonal events, promotions, or product launches) to replicate success in similar months.
   - Mitigate sales slumps during April–May by scheduling marketing pushes, product campaigns, or loyalty initiatives in advance.
   - Capitalize on high-growth months (Oct, Mar, Jul) to refine promotion timing and strengthen overall year-round stability.
   - Refocus efforts on sustaining momentum after spikes by improving repeat customer engagement and monitoring conversion efficiency post-peak.
